## Dependencies

### Required

- ✅ `jest` - Already installed
- ✅ `ts-jest` - Already installed
- ✅ `@types/jest` - Already installed

### Additional Required for .coderabbit.test.ts

- ⚠️  `yaml` - **Needs to be installed**

```bash
npm install --save-dev yaml
```

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific test file

```bash
npm test test-file.test.ts
npm test .coderabbit.test.ts
```

### Run with coverage

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Run in watch mode

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Characteristics

### test-file.test.ts

- **Pure function testing**: Focuses on the pure aspects of `testFunction`
- **Side effect verification**: Mocks and verifies console.log calls
- **Performance validation**: Ensures function executes efficiently
- **Type safety**: Validates TypeScript types at runtime
- **Comprehensive edge cases**: Tests various invocation patterns

### .coderabbit.test.ts

- **Configuration validation**: Ensures YAML file is valid and well-formed
- **Schema compliance**: Validates all required fields and types
- **Change verification**: Tests specifically for changes made in this branch
  - ✅ Profile changed from 'chill' to 'assertive'
  - ✅ request_changes_workflow changed from false to true
  - ✅ poem changed from true to false
  - ✅ collapse_ellipsis field removed
- **Semantic consistency**: Validates logical relationships between fields
- **Integration ready**: Tests for CI/CD compatibility

## Code Quality

Both test files follow:
- ✅ Jest best practices
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Proper setup/teardown
- ✅ Grouped test suites (describe blocks)
- ✅ DRY principles
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage

## Coverage Goals

The project has coverage thresholds set to 80% for:
- Branches
- Functions
- Lines
- Statements

These tests contribute significantly to meeting these goals for the changed files.

## Next Steps

1. Install the `yaml` dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev yaml
```

1. Run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

1. Review coverage:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

1. Commit the test files:

```bash
git add test-file.test.ts .coderabbit.test.ts TEST_SUMMARY.md
git commit -m "Add comprehensive unit tests for test-file.ts and .coderabbit.yaml"
```

## Notes

- The `.coderabbit.test.ts` file starts with a dot, making it a hidden file on Unix systems
- Both test files are in the repository root, following the pattern of having tests near the source files
- The tests include specific validation for the changes made in this branch (diff validation)
- Performance tests ensure the code remains efficient
- All tests use proper mocking to avoid side effects
